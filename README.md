# hello-world
First repo

Hello Computer programming world! Im new to coding. I stared my journey last year when I won a scholarship at my local community college for a Web Design/Internet Marketing course as part of the REACH IT initiative to train individuals who were seeking a career change. Since then I've been in learning mode and educating myself. My ultimate goal would be to develop a famous app that would make me lots of money and potentially help others too.
